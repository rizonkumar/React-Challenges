4. The app should support Redo operation that adds the circle back removed via Undo.
5. The app should support Reset operation that resets the board to its original state.
6. The controls should be disabled when there is nothing to undo, redo, or reset.
7. The circles should have fade-in/scale animation upon entering and exiting the screen.
